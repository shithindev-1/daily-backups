"""Splitting one uploaded file into the documents it holds - for the type-detection endpoint.

The caller sends no document type, so before anything else each file is looked at once as a whole
(`GeminiService.segment_documents`): which documents are in it, of what type, on which pages, and
where. Regions of the same physical document - a card's front and back, a contract's pages - are
grouped into one document.

A file holding a single document is passed on as it is, untouched: cutting it out of its own page
could only lose something. Only a file holding several documents is cut up, each document becoming
one new file - a JPG for a single region, a PDF with a page per region otherwise - which the normal
pipeline then reads, verifies, crops and rotates exactly like an upload.
